# XUSD - XDC Backed Stablecoin

## Inspiration
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have faced suspicion and skepticism from many people due to their association with fraudulent schemes and scams. However, the ultimate aim of this project is to build trust among users and provide them with a safe and secure way to use cryptocurrencies.

One way to do this is by developing a stablecoin, which is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset such as a fiat currency or a commodity. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, unlike other cryptocurrencies which can fluctuate significantly in value. This makes them more suitable for use in everyday transactions and for holding long-term savings.

In addition to developing a stablecoin, it is important to ensure that the blockchain platform and the cryptocurrency are transparent, secure, and well-governed. This can be achieved through the use of decentralized protocols, open-source code, and transparent governance structures.

By building trust and providing a safe and secure way to use cryptocurrencies, it is hoped that more people will be able to participate in the global economy and take advantage of the benefits that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies offer.

## What it does
The purpose of this project is to create a stablecoin that is backed by the XDC blockchain and pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. In order to maintain the stability of the stablecoin, it is collateralized with XDC tokens. If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, known as the minimum collateral ratio, the collateralizing assets will be sold in order to reduce the risk of financial loss or any fraudulent market practices. The smart contracts being developed for this project will automate this process and ensure that the stablecoin remains stable and reliable for users. Overall, the goal of this project is to provide a secure and stable means of exchange and store of value for users of the XDC blockchain.

## How we built it
- The development of this stablecoin project involves the creation of multiple smart contracts. The first smart contract is the collateral contract, which is responsible for tracking the XDC tokens that are being used as collateral for the stablecoin (XUSD). This contract maintains a record of the amount of collateral that is being held and ensures that the minimum collateral ratio is maintained.

- The second smart contract is the minting contract, which is responsible for holding the mapping of how many XUSD stablecoins are being minted for each user. When a user wants to obtain XUSD stablecoins, they can interact with this contract to request a certain amount of XUSD to be minted for them.

- Finally, there is a transfer contract that allows users to transfer their XUSD stablecoins to other users or redeem them for the underlying collateral (XDC). This contract ensures that the transfer or redemption of XUSD stablecoins is done in a secure and transparent manner.

Overall, these smart contracts work together to enable the issuance, transfer, and redemption of XUSD stablecoins, while also ensuring that the stability of the stablecoin is maintained through the use of collateral.

## Challenges we ran into
- Developing a stablecoin project was a challenging process for me, especially due to your limited knowledge of how stablecoins work and how to maintain a peg against a fiat currency. In addition, learning Solidity and understanding how to code smart contracts in this programming language took up a significant amount of my development time.

- To gain a better understanding of stablecoins and how to build them, I decided to study the smart contracts of MakerDAO, which is a well-known stablecoin project. However, I  found that understanding the complex code and logic of these contracts was a difficult and time-consuming task.

- Another challenge I faced was integrating an oracle to provide price feeds for the XDC token, which is the collateral for the stablecoin. I found that there were not many good oracle options available that could provide reliable price feeds for XDC.

Overall, the development of my stablecoin project required a lot of time and effort, but through persistence and determination, I were able to overcome these challenges and make progress.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
There are a few accomplishments that I might be proud of after building the stablecoin:

- Successfully maintaining the peg: If the stablecoin has been able to maintain a stable value relative to the US dollar (or whatever fiat currency it is pegged to), this is a major accomplishment. Maintaining a peg can be challenging due to the volatility of the underlying collateral (in this case, XDC) and the potential for external factors to affect the value of the stablecoin.

- Building a transparent and secure system: We have designed and implemented the stablecoin in a transparent and secure manner, this is something to be proud of. This includes having a clear and transparent collateralization system, secure smart contracts, and robust governance structures.

- Providing a useful service to users: If the stablecoin has been able to provide a useful service to users, such as enabling them to make stable and secure transactions or providing a stable store of value, this is a significant accomplishment.

- Overcoming technical and logistical challenges: Building a stablecoin from scratch is no small feat, and overcoming the technical and logistical challenges involved is something to be proud of.

Overall, the development of a stablecoin requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and the successful completion of this project is something to be proud of.

## What we learned
- To compile a Solidity smart contract, you will need to use a Solidity compiler. There are a number of options available, including Remix, an online compiler that you can use in your web browser, and the command-line compiler solc. Once you have written your contract, you can use the compiler to convert it into machine-readable code, known as bytecode, that can be executed on the Ethereum blockchain.

- To deploy your smart contract, you will need to use a tool such as Truffle or Embark. These tools allow you to connect to the Ethereum network and submit your contract to be added to the blockchain. You will need to pay a fee, known as gas, to execute the contract on the blockchain.

- To verify your smart contract, you can use a tool such as Etherscan. This allows you to view the code of your contract and verify that it matches the code that is deployed on the blockchain. You can also use Etherscan to view the transaction history of your contract and see how it has been used over time.

- Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency or commodity. They are designed to maintain a stable value, unlike other cryptocurrencies which can fluctuate significantly in value. Stablecoins can be used as a store of value or as a means of exchange, and they have a number of potential applications in areas such as international payments and e-commerce.

- Oracles are external sources of data that can be used to trigger events within a smart contract. For example, an oracle might provide real-time data about the price of a particular asset, which could then be used to automatically execute a trade within a smart contract. Oracles can be integrated into smart contracts using special functions known as "oracle calls," which allow the contract to retrieve data from the oracle and use it to make decisions or execute actions.

## What's next for XUSD - XDC backed Stablecoin
There are a number of potential next steps that could be taken to further develop and improve the stablecoin project:

- Testing: It is important to thoroughly test the smart contracts to ensure that they are functioning as intended and are free of bugs. This could involve writing test cases and using a testing framework such as Truffle to execute the tests.

- Security review: It is also a good idea to have the smart contracts undergo a security review to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This could be done by an independent third party or through a service such as ConsenSys Diligence.

- Marketing: In order for the stablecoin to be successful, it will be important to market it to potential users and get it listed on exchanges. This could involve creating marketing materials, building a website, and reaching out to exchanges to request listing.

- Integration with other platforms: It could also be useful to integrate the stablecoin with other platforms or applications that could benefit from its use. For example, the stablecoin could be used as a means of payment within a particular e-commerce platform or as a way to transfer funds internationally.

- Ongoing maintenance: Finally, it will be important to continuously monitor and maintain the stablecoin to ensure that it remains stable and secure. This could involve periodically reviewing the smart contracts, making updates as needed, and responding to user feedback.
