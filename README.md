# XDC-DeFi-Hackathon

XDC Transport Monitor

Monitoring tools for road incident management and connected EV vehicles efficiency and sustainability using Ethereum and XDC eco-system tools and IPFS's decentralized storage for better transportation

# Inspiration
Mobility is an integral part of everyone's life. According to statistics, there is one death in four minutes due to a road accident in India. Our app solution will enable effective design, engineering and delivery of ethereum, XDC blockchain technology to make roads safer, sustainable and better using predictive analytics and automation for incident reporting and reduction in hazardous transportation with capabilities pluggable and extendable to 5 different personas: Driver, Police, Citizen, Dispatcher, Admin.

Our solution will benefit: Police Force - 360 degrees access of the incidents to the action/ administration team. They can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, traffic monitoring, managing police teams. Using machine learning they can also predict the incident occurrence at any area. This will help in taking necessary actions in advance to control the traffic. They can also use the solution for effective utilization of staff members and provide road safety counselling.

EV Charging Stations on XDC network for monitoring of charging in EV systems, Connected vehicles for efficiency and sustainability. We are extending and adapting our platform for connected vehicles for sustainability and efficiency. We are currently working on a dataset of 15000 trips, 45+ trucks and 175+ drivers and enabling them to achieve better in fleet management. 

XDC network for renting ambulances at the road incident sites: Borrowing XDC funds by private and public sector mobility organizations and cab aggregators for community ambulances using collaterals: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/decentralized-ambulance
We allow community or civic organizations to set up an XDC account, send funds, and apply for extra ambulances or emergency vans using collaterals.

Ministry of Road and Transportation: Endeavor to change the car accident scenario by use of car technology to make driving safer and monitored for drivers, authorities, as well as other 3rd parties. With a mix of hardware and software, we will provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents.

Citizens and Cab aggregators: Reduction in the number of road accidents.

Insurance Companies: Aggregated/ anonymized driving data and incident data will be helpful to car insurance companies.

OEMs and Dealerships: Vehicle diagnostics and in-car service consumption will be helpful for OEMs and Dealerships.

Smart Cities Policy Makers/ Government: Real time traffic flow, incident alert and parking data will be enable safer roads.

Advertisers: Customers/driver demographics will be available.

Fleet customers: fleet performance, compare against competition.


# What it does

Our solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Ethereum and XDC services for efficiency and sustainability of connected EV vehicles, Tron blockchain services for interoperability and IPFS decentralized cloud object storage. Ethereum blockchain solutions for sorting information obtained from a variety of cameras. With just a cell phone, users are offered a serverless solution that can detect objects in real time and more object types for better accuracy.

Our technical solution enables driver monitoring, incident management and collision avoidance: Incident-based reporting & Collision detection (even when a vehicle is parked) and video footage associated with it. 
Video footage for abnormal driver behavior (complete view of the car with 2 cameras â€“ front and back and open source video streaming), real-time alert and live streaming using open source AWS solutions. 

Any abnormal behavior/activity can be displayed on the smart dashboard in the vehicle. 

Built-in GPS technology useful in fleet management and tracking. Black box car tracking to be able to pre-empt and diagnose breakdowns more quickly. Recognition area built in the central control to pick up your body movements, GAIT analysis Vehicles become IoT devices which can connect to smartphones, take voice commands, change the user interface. 

The decentralized Cloud-Connected Car Drives IoT Monetization. Real-time access to car availability and mobile connectivity enables better decisions making systems.

XDC network: We are utilizing XDC network as follows:

1. XDC network for renting ambulances at the road incident sites: Borrowing XDC funds by private and public sector mobility organizations and cab aggregators for community ambulances using collaterals: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/EthTransport/tree/main/decentralized-ambulance
We allow community or civic organizations to set up an XDC account, send funds, and apply for extra ambulances or emergency vans using collaterals.

2. EV Charging Stations on XDC network for monitoring of charging in EV systems, Connected vehicles for efficiency and sustainability. We are extending and adapting our platform for connected vehicles for sustainability and efficiency. We are currently working on a dataset of 15000 trips, 45+ trucks and 175+ drivers and enabling them to achieve better in fleet management.

3. XDC Transport NFT: My Transport NFT is a project module consisting of a collection of smart contracts working in unison, a Public Goods Fund, Community Resources, that were launched as NFTS meant to raise funds, and bring awarness towards public good causes in clean transportation and mobility.

Our concept is simple yet effective. Provide a safe environment where citizens can learn about Block Chain technology in mobility, Web 3, AI, and all of the other aspects of the space. Through the use of NFTs, and the Metaverse, we seek to engage them towards cleaner transportation practices and fuel efficiency. Also, enable them to switch from petrol cars to EV vehicles.

We have also added many innovative features, like an NFT rentable marketplace for EV vehicles, that allows users to purchase, sell and rent their My Transport NFT. A Redeem, where you can redeem our Transport Tokens for NFTs, items and more.
